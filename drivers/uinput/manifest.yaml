    This system extension provides the uinput kernel module built against a specific Talos version.
    This kernel module makes it possible to emulate input devices from userspace. By writing to 
    /dev/uinput (or /dev/input/uinput) device, a process can create a virtual input device with 
    specific capabilities. Once this virtual device is created, the process can send events through it, 
    that will be delivered to userspace and in-kernel consumers.
